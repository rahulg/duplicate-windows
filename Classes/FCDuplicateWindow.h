//  FCDuplicateWindow is the "Duplicate Window" -- Screenshots form the source window are
//  drawn to the DWImageView contained in the FCDuplicateWindow by FCDuplicateWindows.
//
//  This class implements custom code necesary for window movement and resizing, as well
//  as code to track the mouse as it enters and exits the window to control the visibility
//  of UI elements within the window.
